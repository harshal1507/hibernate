	/*
	 * Dialect 
	 * 		- responsible for query generation (query is generated while commiting the transaction)
	 * 		- component of hibernate framework which genrates below types of queries
	 * 
	 * There are two types of queries 
	 * 		1. Pre generated query / static queries
	 * 		2. Dynamically generated query
	 * 
	 * When SessionFactory object is created,
	 * dialect generates pre-generated SQL queries 
	 * for all the database tabls which are specified in hibernate mapping file
	 * 
	 * for example if we have 10 tables mentioned in mapping file the dialect will generate 10 query each of
	 * insert, update and delete having ID (primary key) as a criteria value
	 * 
	 * the queries which are printed in console which are generated by hibernate
	 * are known as pre-generated queries
	 * 
	 * Even if we insert 2 columns only then also pre generated query is executed and all th column values are inserted
	 * Default value in inserted for those columns which are not specified or set
	 * 
	 * 
	 * PROBLEM WITH PRE-GENERATED QUERY
	 * is that it involves all the column specified in the database
	 * 
	 * to solve, the above problem, we can ask dialect to generate dynamic SQL query
	 * 
	 * HOW TO GENERATE DYNAMIC SQL QUERIES?
	 * set dynamic-insert / dynamic-delete = true
