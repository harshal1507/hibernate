	 * When session.load(--,--) gets called:
	 * 
	 * ------------lazy=true--------------
	 * 1. 	Product obj = session.load(Product.class,1);
	 * 
	 * 2. 	It generates InMemory Class of real Entity class as sub-class of real class by the help of javaasist lib.
	 * 		And then creates the object for that proxy class. this proxy class object will have : id value and a refernce variable 
	 * 		pointing to it's real class
	 * 
	 * 		Let's assume: Product$$Proxy ==> proxyObj having id value and Product realProduct = null;
	 * 
	 * 3. 	When you call the non-identifier method (non-identifier meaning without id ex: getName(), getPrice())
	 * 		on proxy object
	 * 
	 * 		proxyObj.getName(); --> this will use pre-generated SQL 'SELECT' query having id value as criteria value.
	 * 
	 * 4. 	The query will run on database and fetch the data.
	 * 
	 * 5. 	After hitting the database, it will give the ResultSet.
	 * 
	 * 6. 	Now object of real class entity will be created and set the value from resultSet.
	 * 		Product$$Proxy = realObject
	 * 
	 * 7. 	You have already called proxy.getName() --> Internally it will get value from realEntity obj refernce 
	 * 		which is present inside proxy class object.
	 * 
	 * 8. 	Now suppose we have called proxy.getPrice() then it won't go to database again as the entity object is already present
	 * 		in InMemory class now with it's real object -- so here the database call is saved
